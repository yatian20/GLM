\section{Introduction} 
In recent years,  analyses of multiview or multiplex networks \citep{kivela2014multilayer} open up new opportunities for understanding complex systems across diverse scientific endeavors \citep{salter2017latent}, including social science \citep{lazega2001collegial,banerjee2013diffusion},  microbiome  \citep{gould2018microbiome}, and neuroscience \citep{wen2022characterizing}. 
In these applications, it is common to observe multiple networks sharing a common set of nodes, with each edge representing specific types of connections or relationships between node pairs.  
Studying multiple networks holistically 
enables a unified understanding of multifaceted and  interconnected systems.

% could
% integrate multifaceted interactions within a unified framework and 
% enhance our understanding towards interconnected systems. 
% the collection of  multiple networks 
% % over the  same set of vertices 
% have become increasingly prevalent in scientific applications  \citep{salter2017latent,gould2018microbiome,wen2022characterizing}.
% In those applications, it is common that multiple networks are observed on the same set of nodes with each edge representing the connectivity between a pair of nodes.  
% Studying such multiple networks could open up new avenues for understanding complex systems by integrating diverse types of interactions within a unified framework. 
% There have been a lot of studies on a single network. 
% Although naive analysis can be conducted on each network separately, 
% A holistic investigation of multiple networks can be   valuable in grasping the essence of intricate and  multifaceted systems, and can also  enhance the robustness and reliability of  conclusions \citep{pantazis2022importance}. 
% aiming at studying  different properties. 
% Models for multiple heterogeneous networks have been developed generalizing various single-network models ..... , including the 
% There has been growing literature on 
Latent space modeling has emerged as an important approach  in network analysis  
 \citep{hoff2002latent,matias2014modeling}. In this framework, each node is mapped to a  vector in a latent space, and the connectivity strength  between two nodes is measured through a function between two corresponding latent vectors. 
While latent spaces can be discrete, they are 
% which useful for community detection but is  
more commonly referred to as stochastic block models and exhibit unique properties  from discreteness 
\citep{holland1983stochastic}.  
Throughout this paper, we focus on continuous latent vectors and consider latent spaces as  Euclidean spaces  following the convention in the literature \citep{hoff2002latent}. 


For multiple or multilayer networks, various developments under latent space modeling have been proposed  from diverse perspectives. 
Bayesian approaches treat latent vectors as random variables  
\citep{hoff2011hierarchical,salter2017latent}, 
while frequentist approaches view them as fixed parameters   
\citep{arroyo2021inference,jones2020multilayer,nielsen2018multiple,zheng2022limit,zhang2020flexible,macdonald2022latent}. 
Our work aligns with the latter, focusing on  estimating the fixed latent vectors.


Existing studies have consistently  shown that
% a distinguishing feature of  multiple networks is that they
multiple networks   often share  underlying structures  while simultaneously exhibiting significant network-specific heterogeneity 
   % and  
  % contain both shared  and  individual structures simultaneously  
\citep{wang2019common,zhang2020flexible,arroyo2021inference,chen2022global,he2023semiparametric,macdonald2022latent,lei2022bias}. 
When analyzing a collection of heterogeneous networks, 
 leveraging their shared information is crucial for enhancing statistical  efficiency,
  whereas accurately characterizing unique features is equally important. 
 %but  
 % At the same time, 
 % But it is equally important to appropriately address and characterize the unique features specific to each  network.  
 The  coexistence of shared and unique patterns calls for analysis capable of disentangling the intertwined  structural features and still fully exploiting statistical efficiency.

% shared information to enhance estimation efficiency. 
% % Motivated by various scientific applications,  
% However, unique or heterogeneous model components are needed to explain data properties. 
% In this paper, we develop an  efficient analysis framework under  the latent space modeling of multiple networks \citep{macdonald2022latent}. 
% Some model latent positions that are shared with only kernels differs. 
A recent advancement by \cite{macdonald2022latent}  introduced  
% Recently, 
% \cite{macdonald2022latent} proposed 
a general class of  latent space models  for  multiple networks that decompose  latent vectors into shared and network-specific components.  
% , where latent vectors consist of both shared and heterogeneous components.  
% latent vectors in the model consist of both shared and heterogeneous components across individual networks. 
% The model consists of shared components of latent vectors, along with heterogeneous components varying across individual networks. 
Despite flexibility of the models,  fundamental statistical limits under them remain unclear. 
Specifically, 
a critical statistical question 
for jointly analyzing  multiple networks
is: Can pooling heterogeneous networks  improve the efficiency of estimating latent vectors, 
% yield efficiency gains in estimating unobserved latent vectors, 
and if so, how can such gains be effectively achieved? 



To address this, we develop a unified framework of efficient analysis  under  the latent space modeling of multiple heterogeneous networks.  
We propose a novel strategy that first hunts for the shared latent space across networks and then applies a  refinement to achieve oracle efficiency. 
In this way, challenges from identifying shared space and achieving efficiency can be tackled separately, enhancing modeling and analytical flexibility.   
% for estimating the latent factors.  
% If all the latent factors are  distinct, aggregating multiple networks cannot further enhance efficiency.  
% analyzing each network separately can be as efficient as jointly analyzing all of them. 
% It is possible to improve efficiency if the latent spaces have shared information.
% When there exist both shared and distinct factors, 
% To fully exploit efficiency gain from integrating multiple networks,
To theoretically quantify the efficiency gain, 
we develop novel techniques that  
disentangle the distinct oracle estimation error rates of shared and network-specific spaces through analyzing complex efficient score equations.  
Our proposed framework is versatile and encompasses  a broad range of edge weight distributions within exponential family models.  

% Thanks to the flexibility of the new developments,  conclusions under a wide range of distribution families have been established. 
% achieving efficient statistical analysis is greatly challenged by the fact that the shared and heterogeneous latent vectors could have distinct oracle estimation error rates. 
% The key: the shared and  and distinct components have different estimation error rates. 
% To address that issue, 
% we develop novel techniques 
% via semiparametric analysis and establish that the proposed methods can achieve, up to a logarithmic factor, oracle estimation error rates for both shared and heterogeneous components. 
% In particular, we introduce an innovative semiparametric approach, where we treat the  shared factors as target parameters whereas the distinct factors as nuisance parameters. 
% when analyzing the shared factors, the other distinct factors are viewed as nuisance parameters.  
% We develop novel semiparametric analysis tools that can study each compoenent separately. 
% The analysis framework is general and is established under the general exponential family of distributions. 

% and how to conduct efficient analysis when aggregating heterogeneous networks.

$g_n = O(h_n) $ and $g_n\lesssim h_n $
represent that $|g_n|\leqslant c_1|h_n|$ for a constant $c_1>0$, {$g_n\ll h_n$} and $g_n=o(h_n)$ mean $\lim_{n\to \infty} g_n/h_n=0$, and {$g_n\gg h_n$ means $\lim_{n\to \infty}h_n/g_n=0$}. 
Consider a sequence of random variables $\{X_n\}$.
% and a sequence of real numbers $\{g_n\}$, 
Write $X_n=O_p(g_n)$ if for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists finite $M>0$ such that $\sup_n \Pr(|X_n/g_n|>M)<\epsilon$;  
% ($X_n/g_n$ is stochastically bounded); 
{write $X_n=o_p(g_n)$ if for any $\epsilon>0$, $\lim_{n\to \infty}\Pr(|X_n/g_n|>\epsilon) =0$.}  
% ($X_n/g_n$  converges to 0 in probability). 
For a vector $x = (x_i)_{i=1}^n \in \mathbb R^n$, 
let $\|x\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2}$  and $\|x\|_{\infty} = \max_{1\leqslant i \leqslant n}|x_i|$.

%%% (just to provide some references, especially in the area of multilayer SBM)
% In the context of multilayer network data, a relatively comprehensive series of discussions on community detection under the multilayer SBM has been contributed by works such as \cite{han2015consistent, bhattacharyya2018spectral, paul2016consistent, pensky2019spectral, lei2019consistent,zhang2020modularity, paul2021null, lei2023bias, lei2023computational}. These studies extend from exploring basic aggregation strategies to addressing more advanced issues related to signal cancellation and computational constraints. Another part of the literature have dedicated to the multilayer RDPG, see, for example, \cite{arroyo2021inference,jones2020multilayer,nielsen2018multiple,zheng2022limit}, which have established estimation as well as inference results for the latent positions under various multilayer RDPG models. Low-rank tensor modeling for multilayer network data has been considered in \cite{lyu2023latent,zhangefficient}, among others. The above types of models can be viewed as linear link models, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[A_{t,ij}] $ is a linear function of the inner product of the latent vectors, where $A_{t,ij}$ denotes the adjacency between node $i$ and $j$ in the $t$-th network. In the field of multilayer network models with non-linear link, \cite{zhang2020flexible} proposed a multilayer latent space model with layer heterogeneous degree correction parameters and inner product kernels; \cite{macdonald2022latent} studied a multilayer latent space model in which the latent space comprises a shared component and a layer heteorgeneous component. We point out that the rate proved in \cite{zhang2020flexible} is not oracle, and the theoretical results in \cite{macdonald2022latent} is established only for the identity link function with normal distribution, while their model and methodology include the cases of general distribution with non-linear link.


\section{Model for heterogeneous networks }\label{sec:model}

\subsection{Latent space model with shared factors}

This paper focuses on  multiple networks where each network is observed on a common set of $n$ codes without inter-layer connections. 
Suppose we observe $T$ undirected networks on a common set of $n$ nodes, represented by $n\times n$ adjacency  matrices $\{\mathbf{A}_t = (A_{t,ij})_{n\times n} : t=1,\ldots, T\}$. 
For weighted networks, $A_{t,ij}$ is the weight value, which could be continuous or a count number. For unweighted networks, $A_{t,ij}$ is binary indicating that the connection between nodes $i$ and $j$ exists or not.  

To model interactions between nodes, 
we adopt the popular latent space modeling framework \citep{hoff2002latent}. Assume there exist latent vectors $y_{t,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_t}$ for $i=1,\ldots, n$ and $t=1,\ldots, T$ such that conditioning on $y_{t,i}$'s, network edges $A_{t,ij}$ are independently generated.
To flexibly model different types of weight values, 
% each node $i$ 
we allow   $A_{t,ij}$ to be generated from  a natural  exponential  family of distributions.
% with natural parameters $\Theta_{t,ij}$ and a log-partition function $\nu(\cdot)$.
In particular, let $\mathcal{F}_{\nu}(\, \cdot \, ;\, \theta \, )$ represent the probability density function of  a one-parameter exponential family distribution with the natural
parameter $\theta$ and the log-partition function $\nu(\cdot)$, i.e., $\mathcal{F}_{\nu}(x ; \theta  ) \propto \exp\{\theta x - \nu(\theta)\}$.  
% and it is  proportional to $\exp\{ \cdot \theta - \nu(\theta)\}$. 
We consider  
\begin{align} \label{eq:model}
    A_{t,ij} = A_{t,ji}\ \sim  \  \mathcal{F}_{\nu}(\, \cdot \ ; \, \Theta_{t,ij} \,), \quad \quad 1 \leqslant i \leqslant j \leqslant n,\ 1 \leqslant t \leqslant T,
\end{align} 
independently, 
where 
% $\Theta_{t,ij}$ represents the natural parameter for the edge $A_{t,ij}$ and is modeled as
$\Theta_{t,ij}=\langle y_{t,i},y_{t,j} \rangle $ models the interaction effect between nodes $i$ and $j$ similarly to the popular low-rank  models in the literature \citep{hoff2002latent,ma2020universal}. 
% and $\stackrel{i n d.}{\sim}$ represents independently sampling.  
% where $\mathcal{F}(\cdot;\theta)$ is a one-parameter exponential family distribution with natural
% parameter $\theta$ and log-partition function, and we  is proportional to $\exp\{x\theta \}$
% Following  the popular low-rank inner product model in the literature \citep{hoff2002latent,ma2020universal}, we assume that 
% $\Theta_{t,ij}=\langle y_{t,i},y_{t,j} \rangle $
% models the interaction effect between nodes $i$ and $j$.

For each node $i$, we assume that the latent vectors $\{y_{t,i}:t=1,\ldots,T\}$ may 
% For multiple networks, we consider that $y_{t,i}$ may 
include shared and heterogeneous components over $T$ networks following  \cite{macdonald2022latent}. Specifically, we can write  $y_{t,i}=(z_i^{\top}, w_{t,i}^{\top})^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{k+k_t}$, 
where
$k+k_t=d_t$, 
$z_i\in \mathbb{R}^k$  represents a shared component over $T$ networks and  does not change with respect to the index $t$, and $w_{t,i}\in \mathbb{R}^{k_t}$ represents a heterogeneous component that may differ over $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$. Then 
% and $w_{t,i}\in \mathbb{R}^{k_t}$ represent shared and heterogeneous components, respectively. Then  
\begin{align}\label{eq:modeltheta}
    \Theta_{t,ij}=\langle y_{t,i},y_{t,j} \rangle = \langle z_i, z_j\rangle + \langle w_{t,i}, w_{t,j}\rangle.  
    % y_{t,i}^{\top} y_{t,j} = z_i^{\mytrans} z_j + w_{t,i}^{\mytrans}.
\end{align} 
Model \eqref{eq:model} assumes a common type of distribution function $\mathcal{F}$, which is used for notational simplicity. It is worth mentioning  that the proposed analysis framework can be readily generalized when networks follow different types of distributions.   

% We assume the networks share a common 
% log-partition function $\nu(\cdot)$, as the network weights are often of the same type in related applications, and this can  simplify the analysis. 
% But it is worth mentioning  that the proposed analysis framework can be generalized when networks follow different types of distributions. 

 
% \begin{align} \label{eq:model}
%     A_{t,ij} = A_{t,ji}\ \stackrel{i n d.}{\sim} \  \mathcal{F}(\cdot; \Theta_{t,ij}) \quad \quad 1 \leqslant i \leqslant j \leqslant n, 1 \leqslant t \leqslant T,
% \end{align}
% \red{($Q$ was used for rotation below so I change this to $\mathcal{F}$)}
% where $\mathcal{F}(\cdot;\theta)$ is a one-parameter exponential family distribution with natural
% parameter $\theta$ and log-partition function $\nu$, i.e.
% $$
% Q(x ; \theta) \propto \exp \{x \theta-\nu(\theta)\}.
% $$
% In particular, we consider
% $$
% \Theta_{t,ij} = z_i^{\mytrans} z_j + w_{t,i}^{\mytrans} w_{t,j},
% $$
% where $z_i \in \mathbb R^{k}$ represents the shared latent vector of node $i$ across all
%  time points and $w_{t,i} \in \mathbb R^{k_t}$ corresponds to the heterogeneous latent position of node $i$ at time $t$.

Let $\Theta_t=(\Theta_{t,ij})_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant n} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ denote the matrix of the natural parameters for $t$-th network.  
Then \eqref{eq:model} and \eqref{eq:modeltheta} lead to an equivalent low-rank matrix representation 
\begin{align}\label{eq:model2}
 g\{\EXPT( \mathbf{A}_t\mid Y_t) \} =
 \Theta_t = Y_t Y_t^{\top} = ZZ^{\top}+W_tW_t^{\top}, \hspace{1.5em} 1\leqslant t\leqslant T, 
\end{align}
% \begin{align*}
%     span(Z)=\cap_t span(Y_t) = \cap_t \{ span(Z)\cup span(W_t)\} \Rightarrow \cap_t span(W_t) = \{\mathbf{0}\} 
% \end{align*}
where $g(\cdot)= (\nu')^{-1}(\cdot)$ 
% $f^{-1}(\cdot)$ 
represents the link function of the given exponential family distribution $\mathcal{F}_{\nu}(\cdot)$ in \eqref{eq:model},
operating entrywisely on a matrix argument,
and we define   
% \blue{$f={F'}/{\nu'}$} and we define

\subsection{Identifiability}  \label{sec:ident}
By \eqref{eq:model2}, the parameters $Z$ and $W_t$ can only be identified up to orthogonal transformation, i.e.,  
$ZZ^{\top}=ZQQ^{\top} Z^{\top}$ and $W_t W_t^{\top}=W_tQ_tQ_t^{\top}  W_t^{\top}$ for any $Q\in \mathcal{O}(k)$ and $Q_t \in \mathcal{O}(k_t)$, where $\mathcal{O}(k)=\left\{Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}: Q Q^{\top}=\mathrm{I}_k\right\}$ represents the set of $k \times k$ orthogonal matrices, and $\mathrm{I}_k$ denotes $k\times k$ identity matrix.  
We say that parameters $Z$ and $W_t$ in the model \eqref{eq:model2} are \textit{identifiable up to orthogonal group transformation} if, for any two sets of parameters $\{Z, W_1,\ldots, W_T\}$ and $\{Z^\prime, W_1^\prime, \ldots, W_T^\prime\}$ yielding the same model \eqref{eq:model2}, 
there exist $Q\in \mathcal{O}(k)$ and $Q_t\in \mathcal{O}(k_t)$ 
such that $Z=Z' Q$ and $W_t=W'_t Q_t$ for $1\leqslant t \leqslant T$. 
% satisfy that $Z=Z' Q_z$, $W_t=W'_t Q_t$ with  $Q_z\in \mathcal{O}(k)$ and $Q_t\in \mathcal{O}(k_t)$ for $t=1,\ldots, T$. 
We next establish a sufficient condition for the identifiability of the model \eqref{eq:model2}. 

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:identify}
The model \eqref{eq:model2} is identifiable up to orthogonal group transformation if 
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item[(i)] for any $1 \leqslant t  \leqslant T$, the columns of $Y_t=[Z, W_{t}]$
    are linearly independent;
    \item[(ii)] there exist $1 \leqslant t < s \leqslant T$ such that the columns of  $[ Z,  W_{t}, W_{s}]$ are linearly independent. 
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition} 

%   \begin{proposition} 
%     Assume that $[Z, W_{t}]$
%     has linearly independent columns for any $1 \leqslant t  \leqslant T$, and there exist $1 \leqslant t_1 < t_2 \leqslant T$ such that $[ Z,  W_{t_1}, W_{t_2}]$ has linearly independent columns. Then the model is identifiable up to orthogonal rotation.
% \end{proposition} 
% Let $y_{t,i} = (z_i^\mytrans, w_{t,i}^\mytrans)^\mytrans \in \mathbb R^{k+k_t}$ denote the complete latent vector of node $i$ at time $t$, and let $Y_t = [Z, W_t]$ denote the corresponding matrix form. 

% In Proposition \ref{prop:identify}, condition (i) ensures that $Y_t$ under the model of each 
% single network $\mathbf{A}_t$ is identifiable,
% and (ii) further identifies the shared part and the heterogeneous parts over $1\leqslant t \leqslant T$.

% For each single network, the condition that $Y_t$ is column full rank ensures the identifiability of itself. To further identify the shared part and the heterogeneous parts across different $Y_t$'s, Proposition \ref{prop:identify} assumes that there is at least one pair of $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $\operatorname{col}(W_{t_1})$ and $\operatorname{col}(W_{t_2})$ are linearly independent. {\color{gray}We note that the scale heterogeneity between $W_{t_1}$ and $W_{t_2}$ may also provide enough information to separate $Z$ and $W_t$'s, which is worth investigating in the future.} 

%{\color{blue}Comment on comparison with \cite{macdonald2022latent}.}
% Under general edge distribution and inner product, 

\begin{remark}
Proposition \ref{prop:identify} is adapted from \cite{macdonald2022latent} % which considered a similar model but with  generalized inner product:  $\Theta_{t,ij}=y_{t,i}^{\top}\mathrm{I}_{p,q}y_{t,j}$, where $\mathrm{I}_{p,q}$ represents the block-diagonal matrix with $\mathrm{I}_p$ and $-\mathrm{I}_{q}$ on the upper left and lower right blocks, respectively. 
% Our result differs from \cite{macdonald2022latent} by 
but 
relaxes the connectivity assumption of the inter-layer graph under the model \eqref{eq:modeltheta}. 
Given (i) and (ii) in Proposition \ref{prop:identify}, the column span of $Z$ equals the intersection of all  column spans of $Y_t$ across $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$. 
\end{remark}

% Notably, identifiability under the model \eqref{eq:modeltheta} does not require the an connected interlayer graph as in \cite{macdonald2022latent}. 
% Similar sufficient condition for the model identifiability was established in \cite{macdonald2022latent} by  constructing an undirected graph on the network layers with vertex $\{1, \ldots, T\}$: an edge exists between layers $t$ and $s$ if the columns of $[Z, W_{t},  W_{s}]$ are linearly independent.  \cite{macdonald2022latent} argued  that if the graph is connected, then the model is identifiable up to indefinite orthogonal transformation. 




% , $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$ 
% We next develop a procedure for estimating the parameters $Z$ and $W_t$, $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$. 
% Motivated by the identifiability assumptions in Proposition \ref{prop:identify}, a natural way to learn shared structures from  multiple networks is to first estimate each $Y_t$ and then extract the common parts. 



\subsection{Efficient analysis of latent spaces and challenges} \label{sec:challenges}

Estimating latent spaces can reveal intrinsic connectivity patterns underlying noisy networks. 
Analyzing estimation efficiency provides crucial insights into the quality of obtained representations and is vital for downstream tasks. 
% Studying  efficiency provides understanding into quality of estimation and is important for  downstream tasks using estimated latent vectors. 
While \cite{macdonald2022latent} introduced the general model, their theoretical analysis was  constrained to Gaussian distribution with identity link. There still lacks comprehensive  understanding into efficiency gain from pooling heterogeneous networks under general distributions.   

For longitudinal networks with  baseline  node degrees varying over time, \cite{he2023semiparametric}   established semiparametric efficient estimation for shared latent spaces. 
% \cite{he2023semiparametric} recently  established semiparametric efficient estimation for shared latent spaces  in longitudinal networks when baseline degrees of nodes vary over time. 
Specifically, \cite{he2023semiparametric} 
showed that the aggregated squared estimation error of  shared latent factors can reach the oracle rate that is inverse proportional to the number of networks $T$, whereas the estimation errors of baseline nuisance parameters do not decrease with respect to $T$. 
% analyzed oracle squared estimation error rate of each latent vector $z_i$ as the ratio between the parameter number and the effective sample size $k/(nT)$. 
% When $k$ is fixed, the aggregated oracle estimation error of $n$ latent vectors $Z$ is shown to be $O_p(1/T)$. 
% Similar heuristic can still be applied under \eqref{eq:model2}.  

For estimating the shared factor $Z$ under \eqref{eq:model2}, we expect a similar semiparametric oracle error rate can be established. 
To illustrate the intuition, we consider an oracle scenario  when heterogeneous (nuisance) parameters $w_{t,i}$'s are known. 
In this case, each shared (target) parameter $z_i$ could be measured by $nT$ independent edges $\{A_{t,ij}: j=1,\ldots, n; t=1,\ldots, T\}$.    
The oracle squared estimation error rate of each latent vector $z_i$ can be expected to be of the order of $O_p(k/(nT))$, the ratio between the parameter number and the effective sample size  \citep{portnoy1988asymptotic}. Thus the aggregated oracle estimation error of $n$ latent vectors $Z$ is expected to be $O_p(n\times  k/(nT))=O_p(1/T)$ under fixed $k$.  
To establish the above oracle error rate   under \eqref{eq:model2}, technical challenges similar to those in \cite{he2023semiparametric}  persist. 
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=17pt]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item \textit{Oracle error rates for estimating target  and nuisance parameters are different, but their errors are entangled in the analysis.} Under \eqref{eq:modeltheta}, each nuisance $w_{t,i}$ is measured by $n$ independent edges: $\left\{A_{t, i j}: j=1, \ldots, n\right\}$, so   
 the oracle squared error rate of each $w_{t,i}$ is expected to be $O_p(1/n)$, larger than $O_p(1/(nT))$ of each $z_i$. 
In theoretical analysis,
it is difficult to separate the error of $z_i$ from that of $w_{t,i}$ due to several reasons. 
One is that the individual components $w_{t,i}$'s 
encode both node-specific heterogeneity over $i$ and  network-specific heterogeneity over $t$. 
As a result, classical partial likelihood approach \citep{andersen1982cox} cannot directly remove the  heterogeneous factors.  
Moreover, when the link function in \eqref{eq:model2} is non-linear, such as the logistic or exponential function, 
semiparametric oracle rates for $Z$ cannot be easily obtained by  
spectral-based analyses \citep{arroyo2021inference} or analysis under Gaussian distribution \citep{macdonald2022latent}. 
\item \textit{Target parameters are  unidentifiable.} 
% The dimension of  the shared factor  $Z$ grows  with the network size $n$. 
% Also, 
As  argued in Section  \ref{sec:ident}, the shared (target) latent space $Z$ is unidentifiable in the Euclidean space. 
Actually, the intrinsic space of  $Z$ is a quotient set with the equivalence relation up  to the orthogonal group transformation. To evaluate the discrepancy between a target  matrix $Z^{\star}$ and an estimate $\hat{Z}$, the Euclidean distance between two matrices is inappropriate, and a natural distance is $\mathrm{dist}(\hat{Z}, Z^{\star}) = \min_{Q\in \mathcal{O}(k) }\|\hat{Z}-Z^{\star}Q\|_{\mathrm{F}}$. 
\item \textit{Both target and nuisance parameters are high-dimensional.} Specifically, under \eqref{eq:model2}, the dimension of $Z$ increases with respect to the network size $n$, and the total number of parameters in $[W_1,\ldots, W_T]$ grows with  respect to both $n$ and $T$. 
% Last,  dimensions of both the target factors $Z$ and individual factors $W_t$'s grow  with the network size $n$, which further complicates  the theoretical analysis.  
\end{enumerate}
% First, the oracle error rate for estimating $w_{t,i}$ and $z_i$ are different, but their errors are entangled in the analysis.   
% In particular, each $w_{t,i}$ is measured by $n$ independent edges: $\left\{A_{t, i j}: j=1, \ldots, n\right\}$, so

% Last,   dimensions of both the shared factors $Z$ and individual factors $W_t$'s grow  with the network size $n$, which further complicates  the theoretical analysis.

% Third, the individual components $w_{t,i}$'s 
% encode both node-specific heterogeneity over $i$ and  network-specific heterogeneity over $t$.  
% Third, the estimation is further challenged by non-linearity of link function in the general model \eqref{eq:model2}. 


% Last, the latent vectors are high-dimensional. 



% But different from \cite{he2023semiparametric},
\noindent On the other hand, our model \eqref{eq:model2} introduces \textit{unique}  challenges and properties, 
making existing analyses 
% the analysis in \cite{he2023semiparametric}
inapplicable and necessitating new developments of methodology and theory. We summarize  critical distinctions into four key aspects. \vspace{-5pt}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=17pt]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt} 
\item \textit{Cross-network identification.} Identifying the shared latent space  under \eqref{eq:model2} requires joint information across multiple  networks, as shown in Proposition \ref{prop:identify}. This fundamentally distinguishes from \cite{he2023semiparametric} that only needs a single network to identify the target latent space. 
Therefore, new procedures are required to effectively extract the shared latent space, and  theoretical analysis must properly integrate multiple networks together. 
%     \item  Identifying the shared latent factor  under \eqref{eq:model2} is more challenging than that in \cite{he2023semiparametric}.  In particular, 
% we will show that 
% joint information across multiple  networks is needed to identify the shared factors (Proposition \ref{prop:identify}), whereas \cite{he2023semiparametric} only needs a single network. 
\item \textit{Intricate factor interrelationships.} The relationship between the shared (target) space $Z$ and individual (nuisance) spaces $W_t$'s exhibits unprecedented complexity. 
In  \cite{he2023semiparametric}, 
the target and nuisance parameters are 
 latent factors and baseline degrees, respectively,
% Note that target and nuisance parameters in  \cite{he2023semiparametric} are latent factors and baseline degrees, respectively, 
which  characterize intrinsically orthogonal  information that can enhance theoretical analysis. 
In contrast, our model \eqref{eq:model2} confronts a far more intricate landscape where factor interrelationships defy simple characterizations, which will be further elaborated in Remark \ref{rmk:compare_peter}. 
% This, however, is unavailable under \eqref{eq:model2}, and we discuss more details on the interrelationship between factors in Remark \ref{rmk:compare_peter}.
This complexity greatly amplifies the  challenge of separating estimation errors across different $1+T$ factor groups.
% $z_i$ and $w_{t,i}$  in theoretical derivations. 
% This would make separating the errors of $z_i$ and $w_{t,i}$  harder in theoretical analysis; see more technical details in Remark \ref{rmk:compare_peter}.
\item \textit{Unidentifiable nuisance parameters.} Similar to the target $Z$, the network-specific nuisance parameters $W_t$'s are unidentifiable in  Euclidean space. 
This contrasts sharply with \cite{he2023semiparametric}, which worked with identifiable nuisance degree parameters.  
% This makes analyzing $W_t$'s more difficult than the identifiable  degree parameters in \cite{he2023semiparametric}. 
% and their  intrinsic spaces under \eqref{eq:model2} are also non-Euclidean.
Consequently, we develop entirely novel proof techniques to tackle the unidentifiability of nuisance parameters and establish  uniform error control across them. 
% As a result, completely new proof techniques are required to tackle the issue and establish uniform error control across $W_t$'s. 
\item \textit{Distributional generalization.} 
The model in  \eqref{eq:model} accommodates a broad family of distributions, significantly extending beyond the Poisson edge weight distributions assumed in \cite{he2023semiparametric}. This added flexibility enhances the model's applicability but also leads to additional analytical complexity. 
% A general family of distributions can be accommodated under the model \eqref{eq:model}, whereas \cite{he2023semiparametric} focuses on Poisson distributions of edge weights. 
\end{enumerate}
% First, identifying the shared latent factor  under \eqref{eq:model2} is more challenging than that in \cite{he2023semiparametric}. In particular, 
% Proposition \ref{prop:identify} suggests that 
% % a single network is insufficient for identifying $Z$ and $W_t$, and 
% we need to pool the information across multiplex networks to identify the shared factors, whereas \cite{he2023semiparametric} only needs a single network. 
% % which is not needed in \cite{he2023semiparametric}. 
% % to identify the shared and heterogeneous components.
% Second, the relationship between the shared and individual spaces $Z$ and $W_t$'s can be complicated in reality. 
% This would make separating the errors of $z_i$ and $w_{t,i}$  harder in theoretical analysis; see more discussions in Remark \ref{rmk:compare_peter}. 
% % it harder to separate the error rates compared to the model in \cite{he2023semiparametric}.  
% Last, similarly to $Z$, the intrinsic spaces of the nuisance parameters $W_t$'s under \eqref{eq:model2} are also non-Euclidean, making them more challenging to analyze compared to  the Euclidean nuisance parameters in \cite{he2023semiparametric}. 
% quotient sets with the equivalence relation up  to the orthogonal group transformation. 
% only identifiable up to an orthogonal group transformation. 
% Therefore, the intrinsic geometry of nuisance parameters are also non-Euclidean. 

% non-Euclidean
% \paragraph{Oracle error rates} 
% In classical parametric problems, the optimal square error rate of the parameter estimate is the ratio of the number of parameters to the sample size. \cite{portnoy1988asymptotic} generalized this conclusion to the regular exponential family with high-dimensional parameters. This indicates that, in our model, any estimate of each $z_i$ will not converge in a rate  greater than $k/(nT)$, even if we know the true values of all the nuisance parameters $W$. 
% % In this paper, we focus on the square error of the entire $Z$, whose optimal convergence rate is $1/T$ when $k$ is fixed.

% However, in reality, the nuisance $W$ part is unknown, which brings challenges in two folds: identification and estimation. Firstly, without the knowledge of $W$, we need to first identify and separate the $Z$ and $W$ parts of the latent space.
% (In particular, this is different from the $\Theta_{t} = \alpha_t 1_n^\top + 1_n \alpha_t^\top + ZZ^\top $ formulation in \cite{he2023semiparametric}, in which the nuisance $\alpha_t$ part can be automatically identified by the mean of the $\Theta_t$ matrix. In contrast, in model \eqref{eq:model2} studied in this paper, identification of a single $\Theta_t$ is no longer sufficient for the identification of $Z$ and $W_t$; we need to borrow information across the multiplex observations to identify the shared and heterogeneous components.) % maybe move this to 3.5 ?
% Secondly, the unknown nuisance parameter $W$ further complicates the estimation of the target parameter $Z$. Specifically, each $w_{t,i}$ parameter is measured by $n$ independent observations $\{A_{t,ij}: j= 1,\ldots,n \}$, indicating an oracle squared error rate of $k_t/n$ with the same \cite{portnoy1988asymptotic} argument as above. Due to the two-way heterogeneity of the $W$ parameter across both $i=1,\ldots,n$ and $t=1,\ldots,T$, the slower rate estimation of $W$ is intertwined with the sharper rate estimation of $Z$. In particular, a direct application of techniques in single network analysis \citep{ma2020universal} can only reveal the dominating rate the nuisance parameter, thereby masking the sharper rate of the parameter of interest. This difficulty is especially evident in the theoretical analysis of the eigen-structure of the information matrix. 

% In our methodologies detailed in the next section, we develop a two-stage approach to address the two challenges discussed above, respectively. Initially, for the identification problem, we introduce a novel spectral-based ``shared space hunting'' method to separate the shared $Z$ parameter from the heterogeneous $W$ parameter. Subsequently, for the estimation problem, we propose a likelihood-based refinement designed to achieve the desired oracle rate, even under weak conditions on the latent spaces.


% \paragraph{Space restriction and orthogonality} 
% %\blue{Is there any evidence from data?} or interpretation from model
% Our proposed method accommodates substantial similarity among the column spaces of $Z$ and $W_t$'s, which is commonly observed in real-world data analysis. Intuitively, the varying magnitudes of the effects of specific factors on different networks can lead to these similarities. For instance, if the shared factors have an excessive effect on some network $\mathbf A_t$, then $W_t$ may inherit part of that effect and become similar to $Z$. In addition, if a factor only affects a subset of the networks, it will not be considered as a shared factor, leading to similarities among some $W_t$'s. In our analysis of the Lazega Lawyers dataset, the estimated latent vectors obtained through different methods exhibit certain similarities.

% In real-world data analysis,  it is commonly observed that there may be substantial similarity among the columns space of $Z$ and $W_t$'s. This phenomenon can be intuitively understood as arising from the varying magnitudes of the effects of specific factors on different networks. For instance, if the shared factors have an excessive effect on some network $\mathbf A_t$, then $W_t$ may inherit part of that effect and become similar to $Z$. In addition, if a factor only affects a subset of the networks, it will not be considered as a shared factor, leading to similarities among some $W_t$'s. In our analysis of the Lazega Lawyers dataset, the shared and layer-specific latent spaces exhibit certain similarities. In a related study, \cite{macdonald2022latent} requires the column spaces of $Z$ and $W_t$'s to be nearly orthogonal, a condition possibly violated in real-world scenarios. In comparison, our proposed method accommodates substantial similarity among the column spaces of $Z$ and $W_t$'s.

\section{Estimation of the latent spaces} \label{sec:estall}

In the following, we assume observed data  follow the model \eqref{eq:model2} with parameters $(Z,W_t)=(Z^{\star},W_t^{\star})$ over $1\leqslant t \leqslant T$. 
We  aim to estimate the underlying true parameters $Z^{\star}$ and $ W^{\star}_t$ from the observed data. 
To address all the challenges discussed in Section \ref{sec:challenges},  we propose a three-stage estimation procedure:

% There have been extensive studies on estimating the latent factors for a single  network under the latent space model. 
% However, when estimating latent factors $Y_t^{\star}=[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}]$ for each network individually,  
% % one can only  
% $Y_t^{\star}$ can only be identified up to an orthogonal transformation under the model \eqref{eq:model}. 
% This means that  the shared component $Z^{\star}$ and the individual component $W_t^{\star}$  cannot be directly  differentiated. 
% To address that challenge, we need to consider the joint distribution of all the networks. 
% In this work, we consider a three-stage  procedure: 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt} 
    \item[(a)] for  $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$,  estimate concatenated latent factors  $Y_t^{\star}=[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}]$ up to an orthogonal group transformation in each $t$-th network  individually;  
    \item[(b)] separate  shared factors $Z^{\star}$ and heterogeneous factors ${W}_t^{\star}$  based on joint information across the $T$ estimates in Step (a) above;   
    \item[(c)] refine the estimators with likelihood information to achieve oracle efficiency.  
\end{itemize} 
{As Step (a) analyzes each network individually,   $Y_t^{\star}$ can only be identified  up to an orthogonal group  transformation $\mathcal{O}(d_t)$ under \eqref{eq:model2}. Consequently, column spaces of $Z^{\star}$ and $W_t^{\star}$ cannot be separated, necessitating the joint analysis across $T$ networks in Steps (b) and (c). 
% Moreover, 
% As discussed in Section \ref{sec:ident}, 
% 
As Section \ref{sec:ident} suggests, $Z^{\star}$ and  $W_t^{\star}$ can only be estimated up to  factor-specific orthogonal group transformations $\mathcal{O}(k)$ and $\mathcal{O}(k_t)$, respectively. 
For simplicity, we refer to estimating  $Z^{\star}$ and  $W_t^{\star}$ without  explicitly emphasizing the factor-specific  transformations when there is no ambiguity.} 
% Then 
% $Z^{\star}$ and  $W_t^{\star}$'s are estimated up to separate orthogonal group transformations. The transformations will not be explicitly emphasized when there is no ambiguity. 
% In Steps (b) and (c), transformations will not be explicitly emphasized when there is no ambiguity. 
% , which, for simplicity, will not be explicitly emphasized when there is no ambiguity.  
% \blue{Note that  up to an  orthogonal transformation group.} 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item[(a)] obtain  $\mathring{Y}_t$, a sufficiently good estimate for $Y_t^{\star}=[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}]$ up to an unknown orthogonal matrix transformation, over $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$ individually. 
%     \item[(b)] derive estimates of the shared factors $\hat{Z}$ and heterogeneous factors $\hat{W}_t$ from $T$ networks jointly. 
% \end{itemize}
% (i) obtain  $\mathring{Y}_t$, a sufficiently good estimate for $Y_t^{\star}=[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}]$ up to an unknown orthogonal matrix transformation, over $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$. 
% Then we discuss how to derive estimates of the shared factors $\hat{Z}$ from $\{\mathring{Y}_t: t=1, \ldots, T\}$ jointly, where $\hat{W}_t$ is obtained as the components unexplained by $\hat{Z}$. 
% In the following of this section, we 
% focus on addressing the challenge  of how to separate the shared component $Z^{\star}$ from heterogeneous component $W_t^{\star}$ in (ii), whereas how to obtain $\mathring{Y}_t$ is flexible and deferred to Section \ref{sec:estimateyt}. 
% Throughout this section,  
In the following, 
we assume the latent dimensions $k$ and $k_t$'s are given, and discuss how to consistently estimate them in Section B of the Supplementary Material.

% we first  estimate each $Y_t^{\star}=[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}]$ up to unknown orthogonal matrix transformation individually,  and then separate the shared  component $Z^{\star}$ from the heterogeneous component $W_t^{\star}$ through joint information.    
% In particular, the procedure consists of two steps: (i) obtain estimates $\mathring{Y}_t$ from the $t$-th network over $t=1, \ldots, T$ separately, and (ii) derive estimates of the shared factors $\hat{Z}$ from $\{\mathring{Y}_t: t=1, \ldots, T\}$ jointly. Then $\hat{W}_t$ is obtained as the components in $\mathring{Y}_t$ unexplained by $\hat{Z}$. We next provide details of the two steps in Sections \ref{sec:estimateyt} and \ref{sec:estimatezwt}, respectively.  

\subsection{Individual estimation}\label{sec:estimateyt}

% There have been a variety of studies on estimating low-rank structures 

We first estimate each $Y_t^{\star}$ up to an  orthogonal group transformation, which  can be achieved by examining each single network individually. 
% To estimate $Y_t^{\star}$ up to an unknown orthogonal transformation, it suffices to examine each single network individually. 
For a single network, 
there have been a variety of studies to estimate latent spaces for both random dot product models and latent space models with non-linear link function \citep{chatterjee2015matrix,ma2020universal,zhang2020flexible}. 
For the subsequent analysis in Sections \ref{sec:spectmethod} and \ref{sec:likeestimator}, it suffices to obtain an estimator $\mathring{Y}_t$ satisfying $\mathrm{dist}^2(\mathring{Y}_t, Y_t^{\star}) $

being of the order of $ O_p(1)$ up to logarithmic factors. 
% The rate can be expected by an analysis similarly to that in Section \ref{sec:challenges} and is analogous to the existing rates in the related literature. 


% One research line has focused on modeling each conditional mean matrix of $\mathbf{A}_t$ as a low-rank matrix, which corresponds to  \eqref{eq:model2} when $g(\cdot)$  equals the identity function; see more discussions in Remark \ref{rm:linearlinkwork}.   
% However, they cannot be directly applied to our considered model  \eqref{eq:model2}  when the link function $g(\cdot)$ is non-linear under  the exponential family distribution.  
% This type of work, , 
% On the other hand, several other work has put efforts in estimating the with general and non-linear model similar to \eqref{eq:model2}. 
% For instance, 
% \cite{chatterjee2015matrix} proposed a universal singular value thresholding estimator for estimating large matrix parameters, which is also widely used to analyze latent space models with nonlinear links \citep{zhang2020note}. 
% Moreover, \cite{ma2020universal} considered the canonical model with the logit link function, i.e. 
% $f(\theta)= \exp(\theta)/(1+\exp(\theta))$, 
% % $\nu(\theta) = \log(1+\exp(\theta))$, 
% and utilized a projected gradient descent method to further improve statistical efficiency. 
% To achieve the desired error rate,
The desired error rate is consistent with existing results in the literature and may be achieved by  various methods.  
% The desired error rate  is expected by the existing  results in the literature.%, and there 
% This rate is expected by results in the existing literature. 
% There may exist a variety of methods that can achieve the desired error rate. 
In this work, we adopt a strategy that maximizes the likelihood function of $Y_t^{\star}$ via projected gradient descent for its simplicity and computational efficiency. 
% with initialization through the singular value thresholding \citep{chatterjee2015matrix}.  
The method generalizes that in  \cite{ma2020universal} for a binary network to models under a general exponential family distribution.  
As we consider a general link function in the model \eqref{eq:model2},
different adjustments for links  are needed are in both methodology and theory. We defer the details to Section A in  the Supplementary Material. 
Notably, 
% we focus on the subsequent estimation of $Z^{\star}$ and $W_t^{\star}$ given $\mathring{Y}_t$, and 
any other methods that can estimate $Y_t^{\star}$ with the desired error rate can also be used in our subsequent analysis.  

% although one method is provided for practical,  
% that other methods may also be applied ..
% We choose one for convenience and our focus is the subsequent estimation of $Z^{\star}$ and $W_t^{\star}$.

% In this work, we generalize  the method in \cite{ma2020universal} for a binary network to models under a general exponential family distribution. 
% Specifically,
% for the $t$-th network, 
% we first obtain an estimate $Y^0_t$ through the singular value thresholding \citep{chatterjee2015matrix}, 
% and then use $Y^0_t$  as an initialization for applying  the projected gradient descent method to obtain the estimate $\mathring{Y}_t$ based on the likelihood function.
% As we consider a general link function in \eqref{eq:model2},
% different link adjustment is needed, and the details of the algorithm are given in Algorithms \ref{algor:estTheta1} and   \ref{algor:estY} in the appendix Section \ref{sec:ytestappendx}. 

% When analyzing each network individually in Step 1,  
% one can only identify $Y_t^{\star}=[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}]$ up to an orthogonal transformation under the model \eqref{eq:model}.
% This means that  the shared component $Z^{\star}$ and the individual component $W_t^{\star}$  cannot be directly  differentiated. 
% To address this issue, 
% we need to utilize the joint formation from different $Y_t^\star$'s.  
% In this section,
%  we first develop a spectral-based method that can  effectively separate the shared and heterogeneous components in Section \ref{sec:spectmethod}.
% We then propose a refined estimator based on likelihood information to further improve the efficiency of the estimator in Section \ref{sec:likeestimator}. 



% The overall procedure is similar to that in \cite{ma2020universal}  except that an appropriate link needs to be considered

% The main difficulty of the problem comes from the fact that $Y_t$ is only identified up to an orthogonal rotation in $\mathbb R^{k+k_t}$, which means the estimated $Y_t$'s may be rotated to different directions. Our goal is to identify appropriate rotations that can be used to rotate back these estimates and make their first $k$ columns almost identical. 
% Intuitively, the rotations can be partially obtained through the last-$k$ right singular vectors of the column binding of the estimates since the row space of $[Q_{t_1,k}\ -Q_{t_2,k}]$ is in the null space of $[Y_{t_1}Q_{t_1}\ Y_{t_2}Q_{t_2}]$ for any rotations $Q_{t_1}$ and $Q_{t_2}$, where $Q_{t,k}$ denotes the first $k$ rows of $Q_t$. All the details of the full procedure are provided in Algorithm \ref{algor:initial}.

% Thus identifying $\mathrm{col}(V)$ can let us identify $Z$ up to an orthogonal transformation. 

% Proposition \ref{prop:yqtoz} offers insight into identifying the shared and heterogeneous components of the latent space based on spectral information from pairwise comparisons.
% The key intuition is that the shared component, \( Z \), constitutes the sole source of linear dependence in the column space of \( Y_{t,s} = [Y_t, Y_s] = [Z, W_t, Z, W_s] \), and consequently corresponds to its null space, \( V_{t,s} \). Building on this observation, the Proposition further addresses the challenge posed by the unknown orthogonal transformation. 
Assumption (i) in Proposition \ref{prop:yqtoz} posits an oracle situation where we can accurately estimate each $Y_t^{\star}$ individually up to the orthogonal group  transformation $\mathcal{O}(d_t)$.
% , which, nevertheless, does not guarantee the identification of the joint component $Z^{\star}$. 
% $\Theta_t^{\star}=Y_t^{\star}Y_t^{\star\top}$. 
Assumption (ii) in Proposition \ref{prop:yqtoz} is the same as the assumption (ii) in Proposition \ref{prop:identify} for the model identifiability.  
Eq. \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm} provides the theoretical foundation for identifying  $Z^{\star}$ based on joint information from $Y_t$ and $Y_s$,  which is unachievable when only investigating each $Y_t$ individually. 
%%%% The intuition is that, when the columns of $[Z, W_t, W_s] $ are linearly independent, the shared column space of $Y_t$ and $Y_s$ can be identified by the null space of $[Y_t,Y_s] $; Lemma  \ref{lm:yqtoz} suggests a simple implementation of that intuition based algebraic manipulation of the singular vectors.
However,  \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm} may not be directly applicable to estimating $Z^{\star}$ in practice due to the following reasons.  
First, an  estimator $\mathring{Y}_t$ obtained in Step 1 may not exactly satisfy $\mathring{Y}_t\mathring{Y}_t^{\top} =  Y_t^{\star}Y_t^{\star\top}$, and consequently,  \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm} may not hold precisely. 
% in the assumption (i) of Proposition \ref{prop:yqtoz} exactly. 
% As a result, \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm} cannot hold exactly. 
Second, \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm} relies on the index set  $\mathcal{T}$, whose definition depends on the unknown  true parameters. 


To address these issues, we develop practical procedures based on spectral information of the estimates $\mathring{Y}_t$'s in Step 1, which can be shown to approximate the true parameters $Y_t^{\star}$'s well under suitable conditions.  
To estimate $Z^{\star}$, 
we first construct a screening method to estimate $\mathcal{T}$. 
% identify the index pairs $(t,s) \in \mathcal{T}$.  
% to identify $(t,s)$ pairs that could satisfy  (ii) in Lemma \ref{lm:yqtoz} asymptotically.   
% Notably,   
% $[Y_t^\star, Y_s^\star]$ is rank deficient for $(t,s)\not\in \mathcal{T}$,
% whereas it has full column rank for $(t,s)\in \mathcal{T}$. 
% pairs satisfying (ii), whereas it is smaller than  $ k+k_t+k_s$ if (ii) does not hold.   
% when the assumption (ii) in Lemma \ref{lm:yqtoz} holds, the rank of $[Y_t^*, Y_s^*]$ equals $ k+k_t+k_s$. 
% Throughout the following of this paper, 
Let $\sigma_l(B)$ denote the $l$-th  largest singular value af a  matrix $B$, and 
define 
$\mathcal{R}_{l,j}(B)=\sigma_l(B)/\sigma_j(B) $. % as the ratio of the $l$-th and $j$-th largest singular values of $B$.   
Then we have
\begin{align*}
 \sigma_{k+k_t+k_s}\big(\, [Y_t^{\star}, Y_s^{\star}] \, \big)   \  \begin{cases}
  \ =     0,  & \ (t,s)\not \in \mathcal{T};\\
 \   \neq 0, & \     (t,s) \in \mathcal{T}.
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
% for $(t,s)\not \in \mathcal{T}$, $\sigma_{k+k_t+k_s}([Y_t^{\star}, Y_s^{\star}] ) =0$
% and $\mathcal{R}_{1, k+k_t+k_s}([Y_t^{\star}, Y_s^{\star}] ) $ is undefined.  
When the estimates $\mathring{Y}_t$'s  are close to true $Y_t^{\star}$'s, 
we expect that for $(t,s) \not\in \mathcal{T}$, $\sigma_{k+k_t+k_s}( \mathring{Y}_{t,s})$ with $\mathring{Y}_{t,s}=[\mathring{Y}_t, \mathring{Y}_s]$ is close to 0,  
and then $ \mathcal{R}_{1, k+k_t+k_s}(\mathring{Y}_{t,s})$ would diverge to infinity quickly. % under  suitable conditions. 
Based on this idea,  
we construct an estimated set $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ by letting  $(t,s)\in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$ if  the corresponding  ratio $ \mathcal{R}_{1, k+k_t+k_s}(\mathring{Y}_{t,s})$ is below an appropriate threshold.  
% we decide whether an index pair $(t,s)\in \mathcal{T}$ by  examining whether the corresponding  ratio $ \mathcal{R}_{1, k+k_t+k_s}(\mathring{Y}_{t,s})$ is below an appropriate threshold.  

Moreover,  
% as \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm} implies 
% \begin{align*}
%        Z^{\star}  Z^{\star\top} - Y_{t,-s}\, V_{t,s} \, V_{t,s}^{\top}\, Y_{t,-s}^{\top}/2 = 0,  
% \end{align*}
as \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm} 
cannot hold exactly due to the estimation error in $\mathring{Y}_t$, 
we stabilize the result by  investigating the averaged terms over index pairs in $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$, i.e., we define 
% propose to construct a stabilized procedure.  
\begin{align}\label{eq:gringdef}
    \mathring{F} =\frac{1}{2|\hat{\mathcal{T}} |} \sum_{(t,s)\in \hat{\mathcal{T}}}  \mathring Y_{t,-s} \, \mathring V_{t,s} \, \mathring  V_{t,s}^\mytrans \, \mathring Y_{t,-s}^{\mytrans}, 
\end{align}
where $\mathring{V}_{t,s}\in \mathbb{R}^{(d_t+d_s) \times k}$ is a matrix  consisting of the right null singular vectors of $\mathring Y_{t,s} $, and $\mathring Y_{t,-s} = [\mathring Y_{t}, -\mathring Y_{s}].$
By \eqref{eq:yqretrievez_lm},  we estimate $Z^{\star}$ by squared root of the top $k$ eigen-decomposition of $\mathring{F}$, represented as $\mathcal{S}_k(\mathring{F})$, which is formally defined in  (A.1) of the Supplementary Material. 
% also see  \eqref{eq:skmap} in the Supplementary Material. 

% is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements obtained by taking the square root of the positive part of the diagonal elements of $D$. 

% . In particular, for a symmetric matrix $\mathring{G}$ with eigen-decomposition $\mathring{G}=UDU^{\top}$, we define
% \begin{align}\label{eq:skmap}
%     \mathcal{S}_k(B) = UD_{+}^{1/2}
% \end{align}
% where

% \begin{align}\label{eq:yringtsdef}
%     \mathring Y_{t,s} = [\mathring Y_{t},\, \mathring Y_{s}] \quad  \quad \text{and} \quad \quad \mathring Y_{t,-s} = [\mathring Y_{t}, -\mathring Y_{s}].
% \end{align}


% we construct an estimated index set $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ by examining whether a  ratio $ \mathcal{R}_{1, k+k_t+k_s}([Y_t, Y_s] )$ is below an appropriate threshold. 


% $\mathcal{R}_{1, k+k_t+k_s}([Y_t, Y_s] )$ would diverge to infinity as $n$ goes to infinity.   


% We pool the estimations from all possible pairs to improve the accuracy. % (or maybe just delete this sentence? logically just link to " characterize the estimation errors carefully.")
% Second, to ensure that \eqref{eq:rowqnully} holds, 
% we incorporate a screening step to identify $(t,s)$ pairs satisfying that $ [\hat{Y}_t, \hat{Y}_{s} ] V_{\perp}$ is non-singular.  % we incorporate a screening step to identify $(t,s)$ pairs with different $W_t,W_s$ spaces so as to be useful for separation of $Z$ and $W$ components.
% The proof needs to  characterize the estimation errors carefully.

\subsection{Likelihood-based refinement} \label{sec:likeestimator}


The spectral method in Section \ref{sec:spectmethod} is computationally efficient and could be used under    weak assumptions on data distribution. 
% its construction essentially relies on weak assumptions. 
However, when the data distribution is available, 
the spectral method may not be optimal for estimating the shared space  $Z^{\star}$ in the sense of statistical efficiency discussed in Section \ref{sec:challenges}, as the joint likelihood information is not fully exploited. 
% due to the negligence of the joint likelihood information. \blue{(likelihood is used in Step 1.)}
We next propose a likelihood-based refinement procedure 
% that can further refine the  spectral estimator in Section \ref{sec:spectmethod}, 
and theoretically demonstrate its optimality in Section \ref{sec:theory}. 



% In particular, we use the spectral estimator in Section \ref{sec:spectmethod} as an initialization and then maximize the likelihood function through projected gradient descent. 
% To further improve the

% In particular,  we maximize the likelihood function of

% the model parameters $Z$ and $W_t$   through the first-order projected gradient descent and second-order Newton-Raphson update, while  
% the spectral estimators in Section \ref{sec:spectmethod} can be as an initialization.  
Under the model \eqref{eq:model}, the log-likelihood function with respect to $Z$ and $W_t$'s satisfies
% for the $t$-th network with respect to $Z$ and $W_t$, denoted as $   \ell_t(Z, W_t) $,  satisfies  
% \red{(maybe do not need to introduce $\ell_t$)}
\begin{align}\label{eq:zwlikelihood}
    \ell(Z, W) \propto  \sum_{t=1}^T\sum_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant j \leqslant n}\left\{A_{t, i j}\big( \langle z_i, z_j\rangle + \langle w_{t,i}, w_{t,j}\rangle \big)-\nu \big(\langle z_i, z_j\rangle + \langle w_{t,i}, w_{t,j}\rangle \big)\right\}, 
\end{align}
where we denote $W = [W_1, \ldots, W_T]$ for simplicity.
Our refinement procedure  first conducts the projected gradient descent \citep{chen2015fast}, primarily using first-order derivatives of the likelihood function that can be efficiently computed. Specifically,  the algorithm descends  parameters along their gradient directions with pre-specified step sizes 
 and then projects  updated estimates to  pre-specified constraint sets for parameters. 
  The detailed  steps are summarized in Algorithm  \ref{algor:refine} with notations explained in Section \ref{sec:algodetail}.   
Let $\check{Z}$ and $\check{W}_t$'s denote the estimates 
% for $Z^{\star}$ and $W^{\star}_t$ obtained 
after sufficient iterations of the projected gradient descent.

% \bigskip
% First, for the projected gradient descent, in each iteration,
% % of the projected gradient descent, 
% we  descend  parameters along their gradient directions with pre-specified step sizes, and then project  updated estimates to  pre-specified constraint sets for $Z$ and $W_t$. 
% The detailed steps are provided in Algorithm  \ref{algor:refine}, 
% where  $\dot{\ell}_{t,Z}(Z,W_t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ and $\dot{\ell}_{t,W_t}(Z,W_t)\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k_t}$ represent the partial derivatives of $\ell_t(Z,W_t)$ with respect to matrices $Z $ and $ W_t$, respectively,  and $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{C}}(\cdot)$ represents a projection operator given a pre-specified  constraint set $\mathcal{C}$. 
% Let $\check{Z}$ and $\check{W}_t$ denote the estimates for $Z^{\star}$ and $W^{\star}_t$ obtained after sufficient iterations of the projected gradient descent. 



% Note that gradient descent is conducted  with the first-order derivatives of the likelihood function. 
% primarily utilizes the first-order information of the likelihood function.  
% To,  
Then the refinement procedure   further constructs a  second-order update, which  utilizes  efficient influence function
% of the likelihood function 
and provides convenience for   theoretically establishing desired  statistical error rate. 
% update  based on second-order information, specifically an efficient Netwon-Raphson update to be specified below. 
For the ease of introducing formula below, we denote a vectorization of all the entrywise parameters of $[Z, W_1,\ldots ,W_T]$  as   
% in $Z$ and $W_t$ represented as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:vectorization}
    v= \left[z_1^{\top},\ldots, z_n^{\top},w_{1,1}^{\top},\ldots, w_{1,n}^{\top},\ldots, w_{T,1}^{\top},\ldots, w_{T,n}^{\top}\right]^{\top}  \in \mathbb{R}^{ n(k+\ksum )\times 1},  
\end{align}
where $\ksum=k_1+\cdots+k_T$, 
and similarly define $\check{v}$ as the vectorization of $[\check{Z},\check{W}_1,\ldots, \check{W}_T]$.  
Then $\ell(Z,W)=\ell(v)$, and let  $\dot{\ell}(v)$ denote the partial derivative of $\ell(v)$ with respect to $v$.
We construct a second-order update as 
\begin{align} \label{eq:newtononev}
    \hat{v} = \check{v} + I(\check{v})^{+}\dot{\ell}(\check{v}), 
\end{align}
where $B^{+}$ represents the pseudo-Moore-Penrose inverse of a matrix $B$, which is uniquely defined, and 
$ I(v)=\EXPT\{ \dot{\ell}(v) \dot{\ell}(v)^{\top}\} $  is the Fisher information matrix of $v$ with   expectation taken under the model \eqref{eq:model} with parameters $v$. An analytical formula for $I(v)$  is derived for practical use in Section D.5.3 of the Supplementary Material.
The final estimators $\hat{Z}$ and $\hat{W}_t$'s are obtained through realigning $\hat{v}$ into matrices. 

\begin{remark}\label{rm:onestepiv}
Our proof shows $I(\check{v})$ in \eqref{eq:newtononev}  is singular, necessitating the use of pseudo inverse in \eqref{eq:newtononev}. Intuitively, this  singularity arises from the unidentifiability of latent factors $Z$ and $W_t$ \citep{little2010parameter}. 
% Specifically, we prove that rank of $I(v)$ equals $\sum_{t=0}^T[nk_t-k_t(k_t-1)/2]$ where we define $k_0=k$ for notational simplicity. 
% This rank equals the total number of parameters in $[Z,W_1,\ldots, W_T]$ minus the dimensions of $\mathcal{O}(k_t)$ for $0\leqslant t\leqslant T$,  
% as each $\mathcal{O}(k_t)$  is an orthogonal Stiefel manifold
%  with dimension $k_t(k_t-1)/2$ \citep[][Section 3.3.2]{absil2008optimization}. 
 % The singularity of $I(v)$
It makes the theoretical analysis challenging and conclusions for classical one-step estimator \citep{van2000asymptotic} inapplicable. 
Moreover, the efficient one-step update \eqref{eq:newtononev} is simultaneously  constructed for $1+T$ groups of 
  latent factors $[Z,W_1,\ldots, W_T]$.  
 This markedly differs from \cite{he2023semiparametric} that constructs one-step estimator for shared latent factors only and  requires network-specific parameters to be identifiable.  
% This significantly differs from the semiparametric one-step estimator in \cite{he2023semiparametric} constructed for shared latent factors only. 
As a result, our theoretical analysis pioneers a new approach that jointly analyzes 
all the parameters in \eqref{eq:vectorization}  and  tackles inherent singularity of the information matrix from multiple groups of latent factors. More details are given in  Section D.5.4 of the Supplementary Material.

Besides the studied model  \eqref{eq:model}, there are various other models extracting node-wise latent embeddings from multiple networks. 
One research line extends the random dot product graphs \citep{young2007random,athreya2018survey} to multilayer networks \citep{arroyo2021inference,zheng2022limit}. 
% As mentioned in Remark \ref{rm:linearlinkwork}, 
These models typically corresponds to an identity link function in \eqref{eq:model2} and thus cannot directly address the challenges under models with general non-linear link functions. 
Another class of models adopt non-linear canonical link functions   
\citep{hoff2002latent,ma2020universal} and develop extensions for multiple networks \citep{zhang2020flexible,macdonald2022latent,he2023semiparametric}. 
% In the above studies, one common interest is  to estimate  latent embeddings shared across multiple networks. 
% The proposed 
Our developments under 
model  \eqref{eq:model} 
% is similar to those existing models but
advance the  literature by  establishing a unified theoretical framework that can encompass a variety of general link functions and allow heterogeneous latent factors with complex relationships.  
We summarize properties and results under the related models in  Table \ref{table::summary_multilayer},
where the theory under \eqref{eq:model} will be formally presented in Section \ref{sec:theory}. 
Notably, oracle error rate  of the shared parameters in this paper is consistent with earlier work in \cite{arroyo2021inference}, \cite{macdonald2022latent}, and  \cite{he2023semiparametric}.





Targeting at distinct properties and challenges, researchers have also proposed other models for multiple networks. 
Examples include 
multilayer stochastic block models  for community detection \citep{han2015consistent, paul2016consistent, lei2019consistent}, and tensor-decomposition-based models for effective dimension reduction \citep{lyu2023latent,zhangefficient}, etc. 
Although these models may also incorporate shared and heterogeneous structures across multiple networks, 
their analytical objectives and challenges differ from our focus on estimating continuous node-wise latent embeddings and thus cannot be directly compared as in Table \ref{table::summary_multilayer}. 










\section{Theory for estimating latent spaces} \label{sec:theory} 
In this section, we establish estimation error rates of  Algorithms \ref{algor:initial} and \ref{algor:refine} in Theorems \ref{thm:initial} and \ref{thm:onestep}, respectively.  
% Our theoretical results base on the following
For technical developments, 
we impose regularity 
assumptions on the true parameters in Condition \ref{cond:truevalue} and edge-wise distribution  in Condition \ref{cond:parfunction} below. 
% In the following, we use $(Z^{\star},W^{\star})$ to denote the true value of $(Z,W)$.

% \begin{condition} \label{cond:truevalue}
% \textcolor{gray}{For a matrix $X \in \mathbb R^{n \times m}$, let $\mathcal{G}(X) = X^\mytrans X \in \mathbb R^{m \times m}$ denote the Gram matrix of $X$. 
% Assume that there exist positive constants $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$ such that
% \begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
% \item[(i)]  $\|Z^{\star}\|_{2 \to \infty} \leqslant  M_{1}$ and for any $1\leqslant t \leqslant T$, $  \|W_{t}^{\star}\|_{2 \to \infty}
% \leqslant  M_{1}$;
% \item[(ii)] for any $1 \leqslant t \leqslant T$, $\sigma_{\operatorname{min}}\{\mathcal{G}([Z^\star, W_t^\star]) /n\} \geqslant M_2 $;
% \item[(iii)] there exist $1 \leqslant t < s \leqslant T$ such that $\sigma_{\operatorname{min}}\{\mathcal{G}([Z^\star, W_{t}^\star, W_{s}^\star]) /n \} \geqslant M_3 $.
% \end{itemize}}
% \end{condition}

\begin{condition} \label{cond:truevalue}
For a matrix $X \in \mathbb R^{n \times m}$, let $\mathcal{G}(X) = X^\mytrans X / n \in \mathbb R^{m \times m}$ denote the Gram matrix of $X$ standardized by its row number and let $\sigma
_{\operatorname{min}}(X)$ denote the minimum singular
value of $X$. 
Assume that there exist positive constants $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$ such that
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[(i)]  $\|Z^{\star}\|_{2 \to \infty} \leqslant  M_{1}$ and for any $1\leqslant t \leqslant T$, $  \|W_{t}^{\star}\|_{2 \to \infty}
\leqslant  M_{1}$;

\item[(ii)] for any $1 \leqslant t \leqslant T$, 
$\sigma_{\operatorname{min}}(G_{t}^{\star})\geqslant M_2 $ for $G_t^{\star}=\mathcal{G}([Z^\star, W_t^\star]) $; 
% $\sigma_{\operatorname{min}}\{\mathcal{G}([Z^\star, W_t^\star]) /n\} \geqslant M_2 $;

\item[(iii)] there exist $1 \leqslant t < s \leqslant T$ such that $\sigma_{\operatorname{min}}(G_{t,s}^{\star} ) \geqslant M_3 $ for $G_{t,s}^{\star}=\mathcal{G}([Z^\star, W_{t}^\star, W_{s}^\star])$.
\end{itemize}
\end{condition}

{We describe Condition \ref{cond:truevalue} on one set of true parameters $(Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star})$ for convenience and clarity.
It is equivalent to impose Condition \ref{cond:truevalue}  on the equivalence classes of $Z^{\star}$ and $ W_t^{\star}$ that are identifiable up to orthogonal transformations. 
% But this would not affect the conditions....
In particular,  Condition \ref{cond:truevalue} is satisfied for $Z^{\star}$ and $W_t^{\star}$ if and only if it is satisfied for $Z^{\star}Q$ and $W_t^{\star}Q_t$ with $Q\in \mathcal{O}(k)$ and $Q_t\in \mathcal{O}(k_t)$ over $1\leqslant t\leqslant T$, since the matrix norms remain the same.} 

 Condition \ref{cond:truevalue} (i) implies that  $\ell_2$-norms of the latent vector $z_i^\star$ and $w_{t,i}^\star$  are bounded over all $i$ uniformly.
 It constrains all the parameters to be in a bounded space, 
 which is a prevalent mild assumption in high-dimensional network analysis \citep{ ma2020universal, zheng2022limit}. 
 % Condition \ref{cond:truevalue} (ii) and (iii)  slightly modify the identifiability condition in Proposition \ref{prop:identify} to a rate version, which assumes significant signals of the latent vectors. 
 Condition \ref{cond:truevalue} (ii) and (iii) impose  constraints on the scaled  Gram matrices of the latent factors.
They imply that the columns of $[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}]$ (for any $t$) and $[Z^{\star}, W_t^{\star}, W_s^{\star}]$ (for one pair of $\{t,s\}$) are linearly independent, ensuring that the true model parameters are identifiable by Proposition \ref{prop:identify}.

%    Under a normal-identity link model with assumptions including \eqref{eq:condpeter2}, \cite{macdonald2022latent} establishes an error rate of the order  $\|\hat{F} - F^{\star}\|_{\mathrm{F}}/n = O_p(1/T)$ and $\|\hat{G}_t - G_t^{\star}\|_{\mathrm{F}}/n = O_p(1)$ for their estimator, where $F=ZZ^\top$ and $G_t = W_t W_t^\top$ in our notation. \red{not mention estimation rate here} To our understanding, assumption \eqref{eq:condpeter2} is required in their work not due to the theoretical analysis but rather because of methodological differences. Their approach simultaneously pursues space separation and estimation in one step via a penalized likelihood:
% \begin{equation}
% \min_{F, G_t} \left\{ \ell\left(F, \{G_t\}_{t=1}^{m} \mid \{A_t\}_{t=1}^{m} \right) + \lambda \|F\|_* + \sum_{t=1}^{T} \lambda \alpha_t \|G_t\|_* \right\},
% \end{equation}
% where the penalty parameter $\lambda$ is of order $\sqrt{nT}$ and $\alpha_t$ is of order $1/\sqrt{T}$. While this penalty intuitively encourages the shared latent vectors to be captured in the estimated $F$, it may not effectively distinguish between the shared and heterogeneous components when there is substantial correlation between the latent vector spaces. Besides, the efficacy of this method depends on the choice of tuning parameters. In particular, different correlation regimes may require different choices of these parameters. In contrast, our proposed methodology separates space identification and estimation into two steps. The first step, designed specifically to identify shared and heterogeneous spaces, performs well even with correlated latent vectors, as it is motivated from identifiability proofs, and directly measures the linear dependence between latent vector spaces.

Theorem \ref{thm:initial} suggests that with high probability, the overall estimation error rate of $\operatorname{dist}^2(\mathring Z, Z^\star)$ and $\operatorname{dist}^2(\mathring W_t, W_t^\star) $ are of the order of $O(1)$ up to logarithmic factors.

Second, (b) in Proposition \ref{prop:condtion3} specifies an upper bound on the singular values of $W_t^{\star\mytrans} W_s^{\star}/n$, which differs from (b) in Proposition  \ref{prop:condtion1}, as $M_5$ depends on  constants $(M_1,M_2)$ in Condition \ref{cond:truevalue}.

Intuitively, it ensures that the column spaces of  $W_t^{\star}$ and $W_s^{\star}$  for any pair $t\neq  s$ are sufficiently different, making it easier to disentangle their respective estimation errors.

\begin{remark} \label{rmk:pseudolik}
The unidentifiability of parameters under  the joint log-likelihood function $ \ell(Z, W)$ makes theoretical analysis challenging. 
% Since it is challenging to directly analyze $ \ell(Z, W)$ in theory due 
%  is challenging in theoretical analysis due to the identifiability only up to orthogonal transformation.

 % For the ease of theoretical analysis, we consider the following pseudo log-likelihood
 % apply the  projected gradient descent method to maximize the pseudo log-likelihood
 $ p\ell(Z, W) = \sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{1 \leqslant i, j \leqslant n}\{A_{t, i j}\big( \langle z_i, \mathring z_j \rangle + \allowdisplaybreaks \langle w_{t,i}, \mathring w_{t,j}\rangle\big)-\nu \big(\langle z_i, \mathring z_j \rangle + \langle w_{t,i}, \mathring w_{t,j}\rangle\big)\},$

where $\mathring{z}_j$ and $\mathring{w}_{t,j}$ denote the estimates obtained in Section \ref{sec:spectmethod}. 
Compared to $\ell(Z,W)$ in \eqref{eq:zwlikelihood}, $ p\ell(Z, W) $ fixes half of $z_j$ and $w_{t,j}$ in the inner product to their corresponding estimates  $\mathring{z}_j$ and $\mathring{w}_{t,j}$.  
% Similar strategy has been used in \cite{he2023semiparametric}. 
This is only a technical adjustment to facilitate the theory. 
With $\mathring{z}_j$ and $\mathring{w}_{t,j}$ being close enough to the true parameters, using $ p\ell(Z, W)$ and $ \ell(Z, W)$ in Algorithm \ref{algor:refine} can give similar performance in practice. 
% Since half of the parameters are fixed, the orthogonal rotations are also fixed in the directions determined through the initialization. In other words, the pseudo-likelihood gradient descent method effectively combines the available information in the $Z$ and $W_t$'s directions with the likelihood function.     
\end{remark}


We next show that the likelihood-based refinement procedure can further improve the estimation error rate in Theorem \ref{thm:initial}.

\end{theorem}

% \textcolor{gray}{
% \begin{remark}The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:onestep} is based on the theoretical framework proposed by \cite{he2023semiparametric}. However, several novel developments have been introduced to address this specific problem.  Firstly, \cite{he2023semiparametric} adopts a semiparametric one-step estimation to achieve the optimal error rate for $Z$. However, we do not treat $W_t$'s as nuisance parameters and instead update the entire $[Z,W_1, \ldots, W_T]$ in \eqref{eq:newtononev}. Different convergence rates of the one-step estimator introduce additional complexities to the analysis. Furthermore, Theorem \ref{thm:onestep} provides the Frobenius norm error for each $\hat W_t$ individually, which is analogous to the infinity norm error of $\hat v$. This requires a finer examination of the structure of $I(v)$. Finally, even when focusing solely on the part of $Z$, the structure of the efficient information matrix under model \eqref{eq:model2} is more complex due to the challenges mentioned in Section \ref{sec:challenges}.
% \end{remark}}
% \medskip

Theorem \ref{thm:onestep} suggests that with a high probability, up to logarithmic factors, the estimation error for $W_t^{\star}$ is of the order of $O(1)$ , whereas the estimation error for $Z^{\star}$ is of the order of
% of the order of $O(r_{n,T}/T)$. 
% Up to logarithmic factors, $r_{n,T}/T$ is 
\begin{align} \label{eq:onestepratesimplify}
    % \frac{1}{T} \times \max \left\{1,\, \frac{T}{n}\right\}=
  O\left[  \max \left\{\frac{1}{T},\, \frac{1}{n}\right\} \right]. 
\end{align}
When $1<T\lesssim n$, $\eqref{eq:onestepratesimplify} = O(1/T)$, showing that the semiparametric oracle rate for the shared factors $Z^{\star}$ discussed in Section \ref{sec:challenges} can be achieved. 
In this case,  $\hat{Z}$ and $\hat{W}_t$ can achieve the oracle estimation error rate for estimating $Z^{\star}$ and $W_t^{\star}$ up to logarithmic factors. 
On the other hand, when $T\gg n$, $\eqref{eq:onestepratesimplify} = O(1/n)$, which is referred to as a sub-optimal rate. 
Intuitively, when $T$ is too large, the degree of heterogeneity becomes larger, and the estimation problem is more challenging. 
In addition, the aggregated squared estimation error of $W_t^{\star}$ is of the order of $O_p(1)$ up to logarithmic factors. 
This is also consistent with the oracle rate of $W_t^{\star}=[w_{t,1}^{\star},\ldots, w_{t,n}^{\star}]^{\top}$,  $O_p(n\times 1/n)= O_p(1)$,  following Section \ref{sec:challenges}. 
% Compared to \eqref{eq:onestepratesimplify},   estimating $W_t^{\star}$ may not be improved with more networks collected.

% \begin{remark}\label{rm:theorynovel}
%  Although the estimation error rate for the shared latent factor $Z$ appears to be similar to that in \cite{he2023semiparametric}, our analysis considers fundamentally distinct scenarios and introduces novel theoretical innovations to address new challenges discussed in Section  \ref{sec:challenges}.

%   T$. 
%   This advancement requires navigating substantial theoretical complexities,

\section{Simulation studies} \label{sec:simulation}
This section demonstrates the performance of the proposed procedures through simulations. 
We first introduce the settings of  parameter generation and then present results. 

% We first introduce the simulation settings below. \textcolor{gray}{, while the numerical results for estimating the latent vectors and latent dimensions are presented in {Sections \ref{sec:simufactor} and \ref{sec:simudim}, respectively.}}


% For simplicity, we let $k_t = k$ for $t = 1, \ldots, T$. 
In Section \ref{sec:theory}, we have pointed out that  the proposed estimators do not require the columns of $Z^{\star}$ and $W_t^{\star}$ to be nearly orthogonal, characterized through $\mathcal{G}([Z^{\star}, W^{\star}])$.
% are advantageous when the columns of $Z^{\star}$ and $W_t^{\star}$ are not nearly orthogonal, characterized through $\mathcal{G}([Z^{\star}, W^{\star}])$.
To demonstrate that, 
we next generate true parameters with $k=k_t$ for $t=1,\ldots, T$ and the scaled Gram matrix $\mathcal{G}([Z^{\star}, W^{\star}])= \Omega \otimes \mathrm{I}_k/(2\sqrt{k}) $, 
where  $1/(2\sqrt{k})$ is a normalization factor, and  
$\Omega = (\omega_{i,l})\in \mathbb R^{(1+T) \times (1+T)}$ has diagonal entries  equal to one.  
This Gram structure implies that columns of $Z^{\star}$ are orthogonal, columns of $W_t^{\star}$ are orthogonal, and for $1\leqslant t,s\leqslant T$, 
$ \angle (Z_j^{\star}, W_{t,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\omega_{1,1+t})$ and $\angle (W_{t,j}^{\star}, W_{s,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\omega_{1+t,1+s}),$
% \begin{align*}
%     \angle (Z_j^{\star}, W_{t,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\omega_{1,1+t}) \quad \text{ and }\quad \angle (W_{t,j}^{\star}, W_{s,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\omega_{1+t,1+s}), 
% \end{align*}
% $\angle (Z_j^{\star}, W_{t,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\omega_{1,1+t})$ and  $\angle (W_{t,j}^{\star}, W_{s,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\omega_{1+t,1+s})$ for $1\leqslant t,s\leqslant T$, 
where  $Z_j^{\star}$ and $W_{t,j}^{\star}$ represent the $j$-columns of $Z^{\star}$ and $W^{\star}_t$, respectively, and $\angle (\cdot, \cdot)$, represents the angle between two input  column vectors. 
% the angle between $Z_j^{\star}$ and $W_{t,j}^{\star}$ is $\cos^{-1} (\omega_{1,1+t})$, and the angle between $W_{t,j}^{\star}$ and $W_{t,j}^{\star}$ is $\cos^{-1}(\omega_{1+t,1+s})$ for $1\leqslant t,s\leqslant T$. 
When $\omega_{1,1+t}$ is larger, the angle between $Z_j^{\star}$ and $W_{t,j}^{\star}$ is smaller, suggesting less orthogonality; similar interpretation applies to $\omega_{1+t,1+s}$. 
We next consider three cases (A)--(C) with $\Omega$ set as follows:

Under Case (A), all columns of $[Z^\star,W^\star]$  are orthogonal. 
Under Case (B),
$\angle (Z_j^{\star}, W_{t,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\phi)$ and  $\angle (W_{t,j}^{\star}, W_{s,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (\rho)$ for $1\leqslant t \neq s\leqslant T$. 
In simulations, 
we take $\phi = 0.1$ and $\rho = 0.3$, corresponding to an intermediate level of  non-orthogonality. 
Under Case (C),
the first $1+T_o$ columns of $[Z^{\star},W^{\star}]$ are orthogonal with the other columns, whereas 
$\angle (W_{t,j}^{\star}, W_{s,j}^{\star}) = \cos^{-1} (1) = 0$, i.e., $W_{t,j}^{\star}=W_{s,j}^{\star}$ for $T_o+1 \leqslant t,s\leqslant T$. In simulations, we take $T_o=4$, corresponding to an extreme scenario allowing part of the heterogeneous factors to overlap and thus are highly non-orthogonal.  
% allows more extreme dependence with  $W_t^\star$ .
% We take  $T_o = 4$ in simulations 
% Case (C) would be more extreme since it only assumes the orthogonality among $W_t^\star$ for $1 \leqslant t \leqslant T_o$, while the remaining $W_t^\star$ are equal to one of them. 
% In our simulations, we take $\phi = 0.1, \rho = 0.3$ in Case B and $T_o = 5$ in Case C. 
To randomly generate true parameters with a given scaled Gram matrix denoted as $\mathcal{G}^{\star}$, 
% satisfying $\mathcal{G}([Z^{\star}, W^{\star}])=\mathcal{G}^\star $,
we first generate $\tilde {Z}$ and $\tilde {W}_t$ with rows independently sampled from a $k$-dimensional standard normal distribution restricted on the set $\{x \in \mathbb R^k: \|x\|_2^2 \leqslant k\}$, and  
 then set $[Z^\star, W^\star] = [\tilde Z, \tilde W] \tilde{\mathcal{G}}^{-1/2} (\mathcal{G}^\star)^{1/2}$, where $\tilde{\mathcal{G}} = \mathcal{G}([\tilde Z,\tilde W])$. 
Given true parameters in each case, we simulate data under three distributions Bernoulli, Gaussian, and Poisson in \eqref{eq:model}, corresponding to edge values that are binary, continuous, and event counts, respectively.  


% \vspace{3em}
% {In this section, we perform simulation studies to validate the theoretical convergence rates of $\mathring Z$ and $\hat Z$, which are produced by Algorithm \ref{algor:initial} and Algorithm \ref{algor:refine}, respectively. Specifically, we focus on three types of networks: unweighted networks with Bernoulli edges, continuous weighted networks with Gaussian edges, and counting networks with Poisson edges. 
% %Under each model, we vary $(n,T)$ to show how estimation errors change with respect to these parameters and fix $ k_t = k = 2$ for $t = 1, \ldots, T$. 
% In addition to the proposed approaches, we also incorporate estimators under the MultiNeSS model \citep{macdonald2022latent} to show the impact of various models and algorithms on estimation.}

% For simplicity, we focus on the case $k_t = k$ for $t = 1, \ldots, T$ in the following. To further examine the necessity of the conditions assumed in Section \ref{sec:theory}, we consider to generate $[Z^\star, W^\star]$ with varying column similarity. Specifically, the corresponding scaled Gram matrix is set as
% \begin{align*}
%      \mathcal{G}^\star := \mathcal{G}([Z^\star,W^\star]) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{k}} \,\Omega \otimes \mathrm{I}_k
% \end{align*}
% where $\Omega \in \mathbb R^{(1+T) \times (1+T)}$ is used to adjust the correlation among $Z^\star$ and $W_t^\star$'s under different cases, and the scalar $1/(2\sqrt{k})$ properly normalizes $Z^\star$ and $W^\star$. We consider to set $\Omega$ as
% \begin{align*}
%     \Omega_A=\begin{pmatrix}
%         1 & \mathbf{0}\\
%         \mathbf{0} & \mathrm{I}_T
%     \end{pmatrix}, \quad  \Omega_B= \begin{pmatrix}
%        1 & \phi \mathbf{1}_{T}^{\top}\\
%        \phi \mathbf{1}_{T} &  \Sigma_{T}(\rho)
%     \end{pmatrix},  \quad \text{and} \quad  \Omega_C=\begin{pmatrix}
%         \mathrm{I}_{T_o} & \mathbf{0}\\
%         \mathbf{0} & \Sigma_{T - T_o + 1}(1)
%     \end{pmatrix}
% \end{align*}
% for Case A, Case B, and Case C, respectively, where $\Sigma_T(\rho)$ denotes a $T \times T$ matrix with diagonal elements equal to $1$ and off-diagonal elements equal to $\rho$. Case A corresponds to the scenario where all columns of $[Z^\star,W^\star]$  are orthogonal, satisfying the conditions of both our and \cite{macdonald2022latent}. Case B introduces similarities among the columns of $[Z^\star,W^\star]$, then condition \eqref{eq:condpeter2} by \cite{macdonald2022latent} is no longer satisfied. Case C would be more extreme since it only assumes the orthogonality among $W_t^\star$ for $1 \leqslant t \leqslant T_o$, while the remaining $W_t^\star$ are equal to one of them. We note that Condition \ref{cond:truevalue2} might be violated under Case C. 

% In the following simulations, we take $\phi = 0.1, \rho = 0.3$ in Case B and $T_o = 5$ in Case C. When generating the latent vectors $[Z^\star,W^\star]$ under each case, we first independently sample $\tilde z_i$ and $\tilde w_{t,i}$ from a $k$-dimensional standard normal distribution restricted on the set $\{x \in \mathbb R^k: \|x\|_2^2 \leqslant k\}$, then obtain $[Z^\star, W^\star]$ by performing $[Z^\star, W^\star] = [\tilde Z, \tilde W] \tilde{\mathcal{G}}^{-1/2} (\mathcal{G}^\star)^{1/2}$, where $\tilde{\mathcal{G}} = \mathcal{G}([\tilde Z,\tilde W])$.



%\subsection{Estimation of the latent spaces}\label{sec:simufactor}
% \ref{sec:simudim}
% In this section, we assume  $k$ and $k_t$'s are known and evaluate the performance of the proposed Algorithms \ref{algor:initial} and \ref{algor:refine}, referred to as SS-Hunting and SS-Refinement, respectively.
In each setting, we evaluate the performance of the proposed Algorithms \ref{algor:initial} and \ref{algor:refine}, referred to as SS-Hunting and SS-Refinement, respectively.

 Since their codes are not available under Poisson distribution, their errors are not presented under Poisson.   
% , with and without the refitting step, denoted as MultiNeSS and MultiNeSS+, respectively. 
% We first present estimation results for the shared latent space when the latent dimensions $k$ and $k_t$ are known. In Section \ref{sec:theory}, we have derived error rates for $\mathring Z$ and $\hat Z$, specifically, $\operatorname{dist}^2(\mathring Z, Z^\star) = O_p(1)$ and $\operatorname{dist}^2(\hat Z, Z^\star) = O_p(1/T)$ when $T \lesssim n$. 
% \blue{In addition to the proposed approaches, we also incorporate estimators under the MultiNeSS model \citep{macdonald2022latent} to show the impact of various models and algorithms on estimation.}

% is equivalent to $\operatorname{dist}^2(\hat Z, Z^\star)$. 
We next focus on illustrating the order of the semiparametric error rate of estimating $Z^{\star}$ with respect to the number of networks $T$, highlighting the improvement over using a single network. % for estimating  shared latent spaces. 
The error rates for estimating $W_t^{\star}$'s are not improved over $T$, which is consistent with our expected oracle rates in Section \ref{sec:challenges}, and detailed results are deferred to Section G of the Supplementary Material due to the limitation of space. 
% For a clearer visualization of the error trend with respect to $T$, 
For the ease of visualization, we vary $T \in \{5, 10, 20, 40, 80\}$ while fixing $n = 400$ and  $k_t = k = 2$ for $t=1,\ldots, T$. 
For a fair comparison with \cite{macdonald2022latent}, we present error  $\|\widehat{ZZ^\mytrans} - Z^\star Z^{\star \mytrans}\|_{\mathrm{F}}^2/n$, which is equivalent to $\operatorname{dist}^2(\hat Z, Z^\star)$ up to constants multiplied \citep{tu2016low}.

MultiNeSS and MultiNeSS+ no longer exhibit inverse proportional to $T$ error rates. 
Under Case (C), errors of MultiNeSS and MultiNeSS+ explode and thus are not presented in Figure \ref{fig:simuC}. 
Unlike Figures \ref{fig:simuA} and \ref{fig:simuB},  
SS-Hunting does not achieve inverse proportional to $T$ errors, whereas SS-Refinement still achieves that.

Intuitively, Cases (A)--(C) correspond to more and more challenging scenarios where the relationship between latent spaces become non-orthogonal and more complex. 
The non-ideal performances of MultiNeSS and MultiNeSS+ under Cases (B) and (C)
 align with Remark \ref{rmk:compare_peter} showing that our methods would require  less restriction on the latent spaces. 
 % MultiNeSS assumes nearly orthogonal conditions, while our proposed method does not have this restriction.  
% this demonstrates that in certain extreme cases, SS-Hunting can only achieve the constant rate specified in Theorem \ref{thm:initial}. 
For our two proposed estimators, 
SS-Refinement achieves the desired inverse proportional to $T$ error rate across all cases and distribution, whereas  SS-Hunting fails to achieve that in  challenging Case (C). 
% although SS-Hunting could perform  similarly to SS-Refinement in favorable scenarios, e.g., Cases (A) and (B), it 
% On the one hand, this demonstrates that in certain extreme cases, SS-Hunting can only achieve the constant rate specified in Theorem \ref{thm:initial}. 
This is consistent with our theoretical results in Theorems \ref{thm:initial} and \ref{thm:onestep} providing general error rates under weak assumptions about latent spaces. 
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed efficient estimation strategy. 
% Theorem \ref{thm:initial} is a general conclusion under weak conditions and may not represent the optimal convergence rate under more favorable circumstances. 

% \bigskip 
% Overall, all methods provide reasonable estimates, and the corresponding \blue{fitted slopes} are close to $-1$, suggesting that errors are inverse proportional to $T$. When considering the magnitude of the error, SS-Refinement and MultiNeSS+ exhibit comparable performances. However, MultiNeSS+ significantly reduces the estimation error of MultiNeSS, while SS-Refinement shows only a minor improvement compared with SS-Hunting. When comparing with the theoretical results, SS-Refinement exhibits a $1/T$ rate consistent with Theorem \ref{thm:onestep}, but SS-Hunting demonstrates a better convergence rate than predicted by Theorem \ref{thm:initial}.  It’s worth noting that the error rate of $\mathring Z$ in Theorem \ref{thm:initial} is a general conclusion under weak conditions and may not represent the optimal convergence rate under more favorable circumstances.

%\blue{discuss: Theorem \ref{thm:initial} error rates is more the joint error. We observe that the rate for $Z^{\star}$ can actually be better. } 



% The empirical estimation errors corresponding to Case B and Case C are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:simuB} and Figure \ref{fig:simuC}, respectively. Under Case B, SS-Hunting and SS-Refinement exhibit similar performance compared to that under Case A, while MultiNeSS and MultiNeSS+ no longer have a $1/T$ convergence rate. This result aligns with our discussion in Remark \ref{rmk:compare_peter} that MultiNeSS assumes nearly orthogonal conditions, while our proposed method does not have this restriction. Under Case C, MultiNeSS and MultiNeSS+ do not converge well, so they are not shown in the figure. Unlike the first two cases, SS-Refinement exhibits significant improvement compared to SS-Hunting and maintains the $1/T$ rate. On the one hand, this demonstrates that in certain extreme cases, SS-Hunting can only achieve the constant rate specified in Theorem \ref{thm:initial}. %On the other hand, this indicates that Condition \ref{cond:truevalue2} is merely a technically sufficient condition, as we discussed in Remark \ref{rm:condwextra}.








\section{Data analysis} \label{sec:data}
% To demonstrate the interpretations of , 
We analyze a multiplex-network dataset of  lawyers \citep{lazega2001collegial} to demonstrate the insights provided by examining shared and individual latent spaces. 
% the Lazega Lawyers dataset \citep{lazega2001collegial}. 
% We demonstrate the use of 
% the effectiveness of 
% the proposed method by applying it to the Lazega Lawyers dataset \citep{lazega2001collegial}. 
This dataset contains three types of connection relationships:  coworker, friendship, and advice,   between seventy-one lawyers in a Northeastern US corporate law firm. 
Within each type of network, we consider binary and undirected edges between lawyers indicating whether 
connections of each type exist between them. 
% there exist type-specific connections between them. 
% We consider undirected binary edge between two lawyers 
Since there is no ground truth of latent spaces in practice, 
we compare the estimated latent embeddings with observed node-wise features to gain insights into the results given by the proposed method and other existing methods.   

% \textcolor{gray}{The data were collected using sociometric name generators, and only the coworker network is undirected. To ensure consistency with our setup, we symmetrized the networks prior to analysis. The dataset also includes various individual attributes such as seniority, gender, office, and practice.} 

% For our proposed method, 
As network edges are binary, 
we adopt Bernoulli distribution in the model \eqref{eq:model} and estimate latent dimensions by Algorithm B.1, which gives  $\hat{k}_1 = 6$, $\hat{k}_2 = 4$, $\hat{k}_3 = 1$, and $\hat{k}=2$. 
Then we estimate  latent embedding  vectors under estimated latent dimensions by SS-Refinement.  
% In particular, we obtain  $\hat{k}_1 = 6$, $\hat{k}_2 = 4$, $\hat{k}_3 = 1$, and $\hat{k}=2$. 
As  a comparison, we also apply   MultiNeSS+ in  \cite{macdonald2022latent} and  MASE in \cite{arroyo2021inference}  with the dimension of the shared space set to be two.

\section{Discussions} \label{sec:discussion}

This work establishes   
a general analysis framework for  efficient estimation of node-wise latent embeddings in multiple heterogeneous networks. 
It shows that aggregating multiplex networks can improve the efficiency of estimating shared latent spaces. 
In particular, we develop 
  a  novel two-stage approach: the first stage 
 hunts for shared latent embedding spaces,
and the second stage improves the statistical efficiency with likelihood information. 
We establish estimation error bounds for the estimators of the two stages. The final estimator has been shown to achieve the oracle rates of component for both the shared and individual components according to their dimensions.  
  The new developments would provide statistical insights into how to efficiently  aggregate heterogeneous datasets and unravel fundamental structures in complex interconnected systems. 

The new developments pave the way for a broad range of future studies. 
First, accurate estimation of latent embedding spaces plays a crucial role in  subsequent analytical tasks including, but not limited to, understanding latent confounders across multifaceted interconnected systems,  adjusting dependence of observations for causal inference  \citep{mcfowland2023estimating,nath2022identifying,hayes2022estimating}, and  prediction with or on noisy network data \citep{ma2020universal,le2022linear,lunde2023conformal}.   


Second, another interesting future research direction is to  extend the  analysis to various other network models. % with additional components to capture various connectivity patterns. 
% the  methods and theoretical techniques can be extended to  
For instance, to analyze networks exhibiting  significant degree heterogeneity, we could add network-specific and node-specific degree heterogeneity parameters in current model, similarly to   \cite{zhang2020flexible} and \cite{he2023semiparametric}. %letting 
%widely adopted in latent space models \citep{hoff2002latent,he2023semiparametric}.   
% the model \eqref{eq:model} does not  
% implicitly assumes the degree homogeneity across different nodes and time by restricting the latent vectors $y_{t,i}$ in a constant range. 
% when analyzing data with significant degree heterogeneity, a natural generalization of the model is to incorporate degree heterogeneity parameters, which is widely used in latent space models \citep{he2023semiparametric}. % \begin{align*}
%     \Theta_{t,ij} = \alpha_{it} + \alpha_{jt} + z_i^\mytrans z_j + w_{t,i}^\mytrans w_{t,j},
% \end{align*}
% In particular, we can let 
% $\Theta_{t,ij} = \alpha_{it} + \alpha_{jt} + z_i^\mytrans z_j + w_{t,i}^\mytrans w_{t,j},$
% where $\alpha_{it}$'s model the degree heterogeneity across $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and $t \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$. 
Moreover, other forms of interactions could be considered, such as using  a general kernel function beyond inner product \citep{rubin2022statistical,macdonald2022latent},
or modeling directed network edges with asymmetric latent embeddings  \citep{perry2013point,yan2019statistical}.  
% to enhance the flexibility of modeling interactions, various generalizations of modeling 
% a general kernel function beyond inner product may be adopted \citep{rubin2022statistical,macdonald2022latent},
% or one can model directed network edges with asymmetric latent embeddings  \citep{perry2013point,yan2019statistical}.  
In addition, when there are observed covariates \citep{yan2021covariate,huang2018pairwise}, it would be worthwhile to devise appropriate procedures for  covariate adjustments. %  and investigate the corresponding influences. 
The  methods and theoretical tools developed in this work provide a versatile toolbox that could be useful under  diverse scenarios of network analysis.  

Finally, our current  analysis of efficient estimation  requires the likelihood to be correctly specified.
However, in many applications, 
distributions of noisy networks  may deviate from their prespecified forms. This misspecification might alter the interpretation of latent embeddings and impede efficient estimations.   Understanding the effect of distribution misspecification would be an important future research direction. Such studies could  provide us better understanding towards underlying data structures and lead to  reliable and robust conclusions \citep{rubin2020manifold}. 
% To analyze complex data that may deviate from prespecified distributions, it would be important to

% directed model: \blue{to do} 
% The paper proposes a general set of toolbox for analyzing heterogeneous networks with two steps: find shared latent spaces and then refine with high-order likelihood information. 
% The idea is flexible and can be readily generalizable. 
% For instance, in addition to hunting shared spaces in $Y_t$, 
% one may also hunt for shared space in $W_t$'s again and conduct sequential analysis.{ \color{gray} For example,
% use space hunting on the $W_t$'s; or,
% a penalty term like $\sum_{t_1,t_2} \lambda_{t_1,t_2} \operatorname{dist}^2(W_{t_1}, W_{t_2}) $, with adaptive lasso type of tuning on $\lambda_{t_1,t_2}  $ }


% combine with heterogeneous kernels COSIE model and kernels in  \cite{macdonald2022latent}
% discuss that if \begin{itemize}
%     \item $\hat{k}=0$
%     \item $\hat{k}_t=0$ 
% \end{itemize}
% our procedure could also provide inforamtion on whether there exsit shared factors


% Several additional components that could be integrated into our model to capture a wider range of effects are outlined below. Firstly, apart from capturing interaction effects through latent position inner products, the model could be enriched by incorporating marginal effects.
% % captured by degree heterogeneity parameters across nodes and layers. 
% For example, in the lawyer network data, beyond the primary interaction effects governed by variables such as the lawyer’s office, practice, and position, certain lawyers might be more active in the coworker network, while some others may be more engaged in the friendship network. Such individual-level effects could be modeled using degree heterogeneity parameters across nodes and layers. A natural modification to the model specifications \eqref{eq:modeltheta} and \eqref{eq:model2} is expressed as 
% \begin{align*}
%    g(\mathbb{E}[A_{t,ij}|\pmb\alpha,Z,W] ) =  \Theta_{t,ij} = \alpha_{it} + \alpha_{jt} + z_i^\mytrans z_j + w_{t,i}^\mytrans w_{t,j},
% \end{align*}
% where $\alpha_{it}$'s model the degree heterogeneity across nodes $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and layers $t \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$. We point out that our current estimation algorithms and theoretical analysis can also be extended to this model. Secondly, to accommodate directed network data, where the in-edges and out-edges of nodes may exhibit distinct behaviors, we are interested in developing a model for asymmetric adjacency. A possible parametrization based on  \eqref{eq:modeltheta} and \eqref{eq:model2} is given by
% \begin{align*}
%    g(\mathbb{E}[A_{t,ij}|Z,W] ) =  \Theta_{t,ij} = z_i^{(out) \mytrans} z_j^{(in)} + w_{t,i}^{(out) \mytrans} w_{t,j}^{(in)} ,
% \end{align*}
% where $A_{t,ij}$  denotes the directional edge from node $i$ to node $j$ in layer $t$, whose connectivity is determined by the inner product of the ``out latent vectors'' of $i$ and the ``in latent vectors'' of $j$. From a modeling perspective, this model invites further exploration into the similarities and differences between the learned in and out latent structures. From a theoretical point of view, the identifiability and information matrix eigenstructure of the asymmetric model are different from symmetric models, potentially necessitating novel technical advances.
% Thirdly, akin to the single network model studied in \cite{hoff2003random,hoff2005bilinear} and the network event history data studied in \cite{perry2013point}, integrating covariates into our model represents a worthwhile pursuit.  A potential adjusted form of the model specification \eqref{eq:modeltheta} is
% \begin{align*}
%    g(\mathbb{E}[A_{t,ij}|Z,W] ) =  \Theta_{t,ij} = z_i^\mytrans z_j + w_{t,i}^\mytrans w_{t,j} +  X_{t,ij}^\top \pmb\gamma ,
% \end{align*}
% where $X_{t,ij} $ denotes the time-varying covariate for the $i$-$j$ edge, and $\pmb\gamma$ is the regression coefficient vector. Covariate adjustment via regression can help unveiling more complex network structures and enhance downstream tasks such as link prediction \citep{ma2020universal,huang2018pairwise}.
